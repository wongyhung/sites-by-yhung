# sites-by-yhung
Sites by Yhung is my personal portfolio and freelance web development website.
I focus on building clean, minimalist websites for small businesses, helping brands establish a strong, professional online presence.

## This project showcases:
- A custom-coded landing page, portfolio, and contact form.
- Light, modern design focused on usability and clarity.
- Desktop & mobile responsive layouts and
- SEO-friendly structure.
- Simple, direct communication channels (Email, WhatsApp, Telegram, LinkedIn).

Built with ❤️ using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
